Analyze successful and failed Kickstarter campaigns Louise is launching a crowd funding campaign for her play "Fever". She has asked me to do an analysis of other crowd funding campaigns so that she can follow successful models and avoid mistakes. She is attempting to raise $10,000 Purpose

Use a data driven approach to better understand what works and what causes a campaign to fail. Analysis and Challenges

I analyzed campaigns by applying successful, failed and the dollar goal. Campaigns were compared using dollar amount ranges (Goals), and by launch date. Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Using the chart "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" it is apparent that the most successful campaigns were launched during late Spring and Summer months (May through August). Successes dropped off in September and were the lowest in December. The chart was built using data in the Kickstarter work sheet. Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Based on the data and the Outcomes based on Goals chart the higher dollar goals contributed to failures although there were failures across a wide range of goals. Successful projects were accomplished even with higher goals in the lower amount ranges. Above that most successful campaigns were accomplished with lower dollar goals. Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Some of the challenges and difficulties were to filter the data to provide appropriate analysis. It was necessary to look at Descriptive statistics, grouping data to enable looking at outcomes compared to goals and launch dates. Dates had to be converted from an unreadable format to a human readable format. Percentages had to be determined and different charts had to be made. Data had to be sorted to specifically look at Plays. Results

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The most successful campaigns were launched May through August.

Successful campaigns peaked in May and declined after that.

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Although most failed campaigns were had higher dollar goals, that was not the always the case. There needs to be further analysis to uncover additional factors.

What are some limitations of this dataset?

A good analysis can be completed using the data set. However qualitative data needs to be looked at. In entertainment there is much more than launch dates and dollar goals that can effect success or failure.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Macro Economic considerations such as recessions.

Time of year such as school starting, Christmas and other religious holidays.

Actual costs of plays for comparisons.
